In this post, we will take our raw data file, _universities.json_, and transform it into a clean state ready to be used in our service. We will use a Jupyter Notebook and _pandas_ to load, analyse, and manipulate our data.

[You can view the notebook here.](https://github.com/WilliamsCJ/studentlayer/blob/main/data/StudentLayerData.ipynb)

In the next post, we'll create our data models in Go from our clean dataset. 

Enjoy!
