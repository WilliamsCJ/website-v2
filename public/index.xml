      <description>In November, I was fortunate enough to be invited to participated in the J.P. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Code for Good Hackathon. The event connects teams of students with several charities, each with a specific problem they hope to solve.
My team choose to work with the charity Movement to Work - a UK charity that aims to tackle youth unemployment. Movement to Work wanted a tool that would help them to explore the levels of youth unemployment across the UK.</description>
