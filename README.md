# My Website (v2)
[![Better Uptime Badge](https://betteruptime.com/status-badges/v1/monitor/eqrg.svg)](https://betteruptime.com/?utm_source=status_badge)

This is the second iteration of my personal website. It's build using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework/static site generator. For the theme, I use a fork of the wonderful [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng). I also use Forestry as a CMS for my blog posts.
